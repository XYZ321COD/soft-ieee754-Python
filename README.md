# soft-ieee754-Python
This project allows you to create custom ieee754 data types for Python and Numpy, which normally are unavailable by the hardware.
## Why
The smallest floating point supported by numpy and python is half(16bits). Somestimes in science reaserch we must go a bit lower with bit precision, and this project should allow you to create every ieee754 floatin point format.

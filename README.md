# soft-ieee754-Python
This project allows you to create custom ieee754 data types for Python and Numpy, which normally are unavailable. Project is still under process of building.

## How to create lib
`python2 setup.py build`

## Creating custom float
Inside common.hpp there is:<br>
`typedef IEEE754<x,y >`<br>
Just type our own x and y. For more information checkout [LiraNuna - ieee754](https://github.com/LiraNuna/soft-ieee754)

## How to use
